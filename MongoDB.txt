=====================MongoDB notes=====================
it's a document-oreinted NoSQl and no RDBMS DB...instead of storing in tables we store data in the form of documents, collections and object format like JSOn format 
it's faster than SQL coz it's built on asynchronous working

The data types we have in JS are there in the mongoDB
group of documents called collections

NoSQL v/s SQL
1.Collections v/s table
2.Document v/s row
3.Field v/s column
collection is not strict about what goes in it...i.e. it's schema less
 
who's age > 16 
 {"age" : {$gt : "16"}}
 
Projection means selecting only necessary data rather thamn selecting whole of a document data i.e showing only some fields and not all the fields of a document

>>Indexing is needed coz it takes time to find the data... --> .ensureIndex({"key" : "value"}) --> do indexing for the field which is unique
we can drop index by .dropIndex()

.aggregate()

To take the backup of ur DBs...use mongodump.exe and to restore deleted(but backed up somewhere) DBs use mongorestore.exe
